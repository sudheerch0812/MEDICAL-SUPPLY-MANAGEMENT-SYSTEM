# MEDICAL-SUPPLY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

The healthcare industry faces significant challenges in managing medical supplies
efficiently. Inadequate inventory management, delayed order processing, and poor
communication between suppliers and customers often result in stock shortages,
overstock situations, and compromised patient care. Traditional methods of managing
medical supplies are often labour-intensive, error-prone, and lack real-time tracking
capabilities, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs.
The absence of a streamlined system to manage the procurement, inventory, and
distribution of medical supplies exacerbates these issues. Suppliers struggle to maintain
accurate inventory records and timely order fulfilment, while customers face difficulties
in tracking orders and ensuring the availability of essential medical supplies. These
challenges not only impact the operational efficiency of medical supply chains but also
hinder the ability of healthcare providers to deliver timely and effective patient care.
Address these issues, there is a need for a comprehensive Medical Supply Management
(MSM) system that integrates advanced inventory management, real-time tracking, and
automated order processing. Such a system should provide secure, role-specific access
for suppliers and customers, enhance communication and transparency, and ensure the
consistent availability of medical supplies.
